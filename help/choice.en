NAME

   CHOICE - Waits for the user to press a key, from a list of choices

SYNOPSIS

   CHOICE [/B] [/C[:]choices] [/N] [/S] [/T[:]c,nn] [text]

OPTIONS

 /B
    Sounds an alert (beep) at prompt.

 /C[:]choices
    Specifies allowable keys in the prompt.  When displayed, the keys
    will be separated by commas, will appear in brackets ([]), and will
    be followed by a question mark.  If you don't specify the /C switch,
    choice uses YN as the default.  The colon (:) is optional.

 /N
   Causes choice not to display the prompt.  The text before the prompt
   is still displayed, however.  If you specify the /N switch, the
   specified keys are still valid.

 /S
   Causes choice to be case sensitive.  If the /S switch is not
   specified, choice will accept either upper or lower case of the keys
   that the user specifies.

 /T[:]c,nn
     Causes choice to pause for a specified number of seconds before
     defaulting to a specified key.  The values for the /T switch are
     as follows:

       c   Specifies the character to display after nn seconds.  The
           character must be in the set of choices specified by the /C
           switch.

       nn  Specifies the number of seconds to pause.  Acceptable values
           are from 0 to 99.  If 0 is specified, there will be no pause
           before defaulting.

   text
     Prompt string to display

RETURN VALUE

   ERRORLEVEL is set to offset of key user presses in choices.
